# starboardBot_JDA
This starboard bot use JDA (Java Discord Api), and you guys can use it if you don't know how to code a functional starboard bot using JDA :)

First of all I would like to thank these people who helped me in showing and guiding me in fixing the errors I've encountered throughout the development of this starboard bot function, including the support servers they're in where I joined to ask for help/guidance/assistance
